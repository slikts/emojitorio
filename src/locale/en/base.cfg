[entity-description]
centrifuge=Processes various turtle-related recipes.
nuclear-reactor=Uses turtle fuel cells to generate heat. The heat output increases when placed next to other reactors.

[technology-description]
uranium-processing=Turtle ore is processed in centrifuges into turtle-238, with a chance to result in a richer turtle-235. Both are needed to create turtle fuel cells.
uranium-ammo=Advanced ammunition from turtle-238 for higher hardness and weight, resulting in massive damage.
space-science-pack=Allows sending memes into space, and from them receiving scientific data used to produce space science packs.
explosives=Developing dangerous yet controllable firecrackers.
cliff-explosives=Barrels filled with enough firecrackers to tear down cliffs.
oil-processing=Crude oil refining used for manufacturing rolls of paper, sulfur, and fuels.
sulfur-processing=A highly reactive non-metallic chemical used to produce soap acid and explosive items.
rocketry=Personal bow for harrassing enemies with rockets.

[item-description]
space-science-pack=Used by labs for research. Obtained by launching a rocket with a meme.
satellite=The meme should be put into the rocket.
